Explore Type Interface

This PowerToy shows how one can use ReSharper to show a tool window with a tree representing the
interfaces implemented on a particular type. It illustrates the following ReSharper features:

 * Action
 * Tool Window

This plug-in shows how to set up the tool window descriptor and registrar with the default
text, how to populate a model from the results of type interface analysis, and how to present
this model in the tool window.

In addition, it demonstrates how to invoke the exploration from a menu item.

Zen Coding

This PowerToys implements the open-source Zen Coding notation (see http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/),
an approach to quickly creating HTML blocks by using shorthand notation and then expanding it to create
valid HTML. This plug-in illustrates the following ReSharper features:

 * Action
 * Options Page
 * Text Control Manipulation

The plug-in demonstrates interoperability with Python code, which is used to expand the
templates. It also shows two different ways of expanding the templates - simple in-place insertion as
well as a 'wrap' action which causes the expansion to occur around already selected text.

The project also illustrates the way to create and show a pop-up window for user entry. Lastly, it shows
how to manipulate the text control (i.e., the Visual Studio editor window) in a transacted manner.

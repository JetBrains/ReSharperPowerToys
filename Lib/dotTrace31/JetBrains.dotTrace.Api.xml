            CPUProfiler class allows application developers to programmatically control the process of profiling their applications.

            <example>
            There are many scenarios where controlling profiler from the profilee is useful. One of these cases is profiling code which is
            slow only occasionally, not always. In this case you might use the scheme displayed below:
            <code>
            public void YourSlowFunction()
            {
              long ticks = DateTime.Now.Ticks;
              CPUProfiler.Start();
            
              try
              {
                // Your code which might be slow and might be not.
              }
              finally
              {
                // This invocation has taken significant time and needs to be profiled
                if (DateTime.Now.Ticks - ticks > Threshold)
                  CPUProfiler.StopAndSaveSnapshot();  
                else
                  CPUProfiler.StopAndDropSnapshot();       
              }
            }
            </code>
            
            This way you can get snapshot each time when your code executes longer than the specified threshold value.

        <member name="M:JetBrains.dotTrace.Api.CPUProfiler.Start">
            <summary>
            Starts taking performance measurements for this application. Note that measurements are taken for all threads.
            </summary>

        <member name="M:JetBrains.dotTrace.Api.CPUProfiler.Stop">
            <summary>
            Stops taking performance measurements for this application. Current data will persist in memory so next time you start
            taking measurements the new data will be added to the current data.

        <member name="M:JetBrains.dotTrace.Api.CPUProfiler.StopAndSaveSnapShot">
            <summary>
            Stops taking performance measurements and opens snapshot with current data in the profiler. After opening the snapshot the
            measurements data are reset.
